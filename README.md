## ABSTRACT

The purpose of this paper is to investigate the applicability of applying gamification approach on 
the physiotherapy rehabilitation. A new developing game called JCave was designed and developed for 
the prove of concept. The propose game target the children from six to twelve years of age who need 
physical therapy in their upper limbs. JCave is a finite and multilevel single-player 3D video game. 
The playerâ€™s role is to collect jewels from a cave and increase his/her score by performing physical 
therapy exercises. The game uses Xbox360 Kinect as a motion capture camera to observe gestures and 
track the child. Automatic gesture recognition algorithms are implemented for elbow flexion-extension 
exercises and shoulder flexion, which are the active range of motion (AROM) exercises for both the 
right and left arms. The JCave game is implemented using Unity3D and Blender to design 3D model objects.
